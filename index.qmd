## Start Here

Hi Cognitve Dynamics Folks! If you're new to R, you can get started by installing the latest version of R from the official [CRAN download page](https://cran.r-project.org/) and then downloading RStudio from the official [RStudio (Posit) download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Together, these tools provide everything you need to write code, build visualizations, and explore data.

Note: Make sure you follow the download instructions that are suited for your computer (Mac, Windows, Etc.)!
