    "text": "What Is a Package/Library?\nDirectories are the location of files. Packages/libraries on R are optional set of functions that you can attach to the coding environment. You can think of them as toolkit you can freely download to do complicated and advanced stuff. To use them, you need to first install it. Then, you can load to the current session. Libraries are constantly getting created and updated. Once you pass the basic level, using R(analyzing data) becomes equivalent to “using packages efficiently”. So, once you identify your specific issues to solve, always look for packages related to your issue.\nLet’s walk through how to install and load a package into your environment:\nStep 1: install the package in your console\n\n#install.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nThe line above downloads the package called dplyr (which we will study together soon!). install.packages(\"name of package\") is the syntax. Occasionally, you may want to set install.packages(\"whatever\",dep=TRUE). “dep” stands for dependency, and it forces R to download all “related” packages to the requested one.\nYou can also download multiple packages at the same time, with the help of a function we learned before: c()\n\n#install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"broom\"))\n\nStep 2: Load your library in your script\nTo use your packages in a given session, you need to load libraries. You can think about installing a package as ‘checking a book out’ into your own personal library, and when it comes time for you to ‘read’ it you will need to pull it off the shelf by loading it into your environment.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\n\nlibrary() should be colored in blue on Rstudio, which indicates this is a special syntax like “for” or “if” or “while”. You can provide either character(with ““) or just a name.\nThings to be careful when you use packages: There are few important things to keep in mind when you use libraries.\n\nMake sure that function names are not overlapping. Each library is often independently developed, so they may contain functions with a same name but different contents. When you load functions with same names from different packages, later ones are prioritized. So, what do we do? To resolve this, you can specify which library is the source of a given function. Say two packages (“packA” and “packB”) contain a function called “banana”. You can write “packA::banana” to use banana from packA, and vice versa.\nRemember that loaded libraries do not disappear even after “rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))”. After you found some form of interference mentioned above, you may want to start over the analysis. To completely start over, you need to shutdown Rstudio because libraries are still loaded even after you clear Environment(workspace)\n\nHere is a resource I found online that compiles a list of useful R packages and why they are useful. In general, if you want to do something in R- there is a package for it so always try to look for them first!\nExercise 1. Look up the function name lmer() using the R help command you learned. What happens? Search the internet and figure out what package the function is from. Install the package and load it."

    "text": "Data Types In R\nExplanation and examples of functions and data classes/modes in r\nWhat classes are those vectors? (How do we check the class of an object again?)\n\na &lt;- \"123456\"\nclass(a)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nb &lt;- c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\")\nclass(b)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nc &lt;- 1:10\nclass(c)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\nd &lt;- c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3) + 1\nclass(d)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\nData Structures\nR has many types of data structures, called modes. We can find the mode of an object using the typeof() function! The most common/important modes are described below.\n\nVector (atomic vector): a collection of objects of the same class. Note: most other programming languages refer to this as an array\nMatrix: a vector with two dimensions (rows and columns). These are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you know that they exist.\n\n\nmymat &lt;- matrix(1:6, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)\ndim(mymat)\n\n[1] 3 2\n\n\n\nArray: a vector with one or more dimensions. These are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you know that they exist. Note: vectors are 1-dimensional arrays and matrices are 2-dimensional arrays. Arrays with 3 or more dimensions are n-dimensional arrays\n\n\nmyarray &lt;- array(1:24, dim = c(3, 4, 2)) # 3x4x2 array: 3 rows, 4 cols, in 2 matrices\n\n\nLists: are objects that contain all (?) other objects within themselves. They come in handy when you use for loops or other iterative processes, or when you need to save multiple data files per subject. These are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you know that they exist.\n\n\nsubj_01 &lt;- list(eye = 1, \n     resp = \"a\", \n     beh = 3,\n     4)\nsubj_01\n\n$eye\n[1] 1\n\n$resp\n[1] \"a\"\n\n$beh\n[1] 3\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 4\n\n\n\nData Frame: a list of possibly heterogeneous elements of equal length (matrix-esque list). Kind of like an Excel spreadsheet in R. DF’s contain rows (cases) and columns (variables). It is often easier to manipulate data in this format (vs. list) because there are lots of r functions that have been created to deal specifically with data frames.\n\n\nPeople &lt;- c(\"Ulrich\", \"Taren\", \"Dominik\", \"Sophia\", \"Neha\")\nPositions &lt;- c(\"PI\", \"GE\", \"GE\", \"GE\", \"GE\")\nCount &lt;- 1:5\nAge &lt;- c(65, 26, 27, 24, 22)\n\nmydf &lt;- data.frame(People, Positions, Count, Age)\n\n#View(mydf)\nmydf\n\n   People Positions Count Age\n1  Ulrich        PI     1  65\n2   Taren        GE     2  26\n3 Dominik        GE     3  27\n4  Sophia        GE     4  24\n5    Neha        GE     5  22\n\n\nExercise 2.

    "section": "What Is Indexing?",
    "text": "What Is Indexing?\n(from our glossary) Indexing — Selecting specific elements from a vector or dataset (e.g., x[3]).\nWhen we are handling vectors, indexing becomes incredibly important! With indexing, we can extract values at a specific position of a vector. These positions can be determined by us, but also dependent on certain criteria.\n\nIndexing using numbers\n\nvec &lt;- c(5, 7, 1, 3, 9, 5, 5, 3) #generate vector\n\nfifth_element &lt;- vec[5] #getting the 5th element\nvec[2] #2nd element\n\n[1] 7\n\nvec[2:5] #elements 2 through 5\n\n[1] 7 1 3 9\n\nvec[c(3, 5)] #elements 3 and 5\n\n[1] 1 9\n\n\nExercise 3. How can we get every second element? - Look up what the function seq() does - Generate a sequence with every second number going from 1 to the last element of the vector\n\nvec[seq(from = 1, to = length(vec), by = 2)]\n\n[1] 5 1 9 5\n\n\nNow, we can also change values at certain positions or remove them!\n\nvec[5] #get the 5th element\n\n[1] 9\n\nvec[5] &lt;- 2 #change it\nvec[5] #check whether change successful\n\n[1] 2\n\nvec &lt;- vec[c(-5, -3)] #here we remove element 5 and 3 from this vector\n\nExercise 4. Generate a vector with 7 elements (You can mix strings and numbers!)\n\nvec &lt;- 10:16\n#and substitute the 3rd element for the 6th!\nvec[3] &lt;- vec[6]\n#Please add the number 99 at the end of this vector!\nvec[8] &lt;- 99\nvec[length(vec) + 1] &lt;- 99\nvec &lt;- append(vec, 99)\n\n\n\nIndexing using logical values\nYou can also use logical values to get certain positions in a vector.\n\nvec[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)] #gets me the first element\n\n[1] 10 99\n\nvec[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)] #gets me the third element\n\n[1] 15\n\n\nMeh, why is this useful? This tool becomes useful when you want to extract values fulfilling certain criteria!\nSay you want to extract those values smaller than 5\n\nvec[vec &lt; 13] #what happens here?\n\n[1] 10 11\n\nvec &lt; 5 #this gets me the necessary logical values\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nHowever, you can get around logical values with which(). This function returns the position of those values that match a criterion.\n\nwhich(vec &lt; 13)\n\n[1] 1 2\n\nvec[which(vec &lt; 13)]\n\n[1] 10 11\n\nvec &lt;- c(vec, 99)\n\nSide Note: some helpful functions with df inspection! We can also get the first and last few items of a vector like this:\n\nhead(vec, 2) #getting the first 6 elements\n\n[1] 10 11\n\ntail(vec, 2) #getting the last 6 elements\n\n[1] 99 99\n\ntail(mydf, 2)\n\n  People Positions Count Age\n4 Sophia        GE     4  24\n5   Neha        GE     5  22"

R has a function called rnorm that will allow you to get a random sample of numbers drawn from a normal distribtuion.
