If you’re new to R, you can get started by installing the latest version of R from the official CRAN download page and then downloading RStudio from the official RStudio (Posit) download page. Together, these tools provide everything you need to write code, build visualizations, and explore data.\nNote: Make sure you follow the download instructions that are suited for your computer (Mac, Windows, Etc.)!"

    "text": "R Glossary:\nFor your reference I’ve compiled a shortlist of R & Computer Science jargon that will inevitably be used when we are explaining basics of R!\n\nObject — A piece of data stored in R (a number, vector, dataset, model, plot, etc.).\nVariable — A name that refers to an object (e.g., x &lt;- 5).\nAssignment (&lt;-) — The operation of storing a value in a variable.\nFunction — A reusable piece of code that performs a task; always written with parentheses (e.g., mean()).\nArgument — Information you pass into a function so it knows what to do (e.g., by = 2 in seq()).\nConsole — The place where R runs your code and prints output, errors, and messages.\nScript — A saved file containing R code (.R or .qmd) that you run from the editor.\nEnvironment — A list of all objects currently stored in your R session.\nVector — A one‑dimensional list of values of the same type (e.g., 1:10, c(\"a\", \"b\")).\nData Type (Class) — The kind of data an object holds (numeric, character, integer, logical, factor, complex).\nPackage — A collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends R’s capabilities.\nWorking Directory — The folder R is currently “looking at” for reading and writing files.\nKnitting / Rendering — The process of turning a .qmd or .Rmd file into a finished HTML, PDF, or Word document.\nCode Chunk — A block of R code inside a Quarto document that runs and displays output.\nComment (#) — Text that R ignores; used to explain code or leave notes.\nError — A message indicating R could not run your code; execution stops.\nWarning — A message indicating something might be wrong, but R still ran the code.\nLogical Value — TRUE or FALSE; used in comparisons and filtering.\nIndexing — Selecting specific elements from a vector or dataset (e.g., x[3]).\nSession — Your current R workspace, including objects, loaded packages, and Console history."

    "text": "Functions\nseq that we used above is a function. Everything you typically want to do in statistical programming uses functions. Functions can take different arguments (input).\nFor example, sqrt is a function that can take one numeric argument. We are going to apply the function sqrt to the value 16.\n\nsqrt(16)\n\n[1] 4\n\n# I could have assigned 16 to a variable first:\nx &lt;- 16\n# And then taken the square root of that variable:\nsqrt(x)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nTo help you learn how to use a function you can use ?sqrt (try it!)\nWe can also use function to do things for every item in the vector\n\n#?sqrt()\n# Create a vector:\nx &lt;- 1:10\n# Get the square root of every number in that vector:\nsqrt(x)\n\n [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 2.828427\n [9] 3.000000 3.162278\n\n\nAnother good example is the function mean. mean takes one argument, a numeric vector. We are going to create a vector called z and apply this function to that vector.\n\nz &lt;- 0:20\nmean(z)\n\n[1] 10\n\n# Now, let's get the mean of this vector:\nq &lt;- c(2, 8, 6, NA, 4, 8)\nq\n\n[1]  2  8  6 NA  4  8\n\nmean(q)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nIs that the answer you’d expect? let’s get some information about the function mean\n\n#?mean\n\nWe need to add an additional argument to tell the function that we want to ignore NAs (the default for this argument is FALSE, that’s why NAs weren’t ignored above).\n\nmean(q, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 5.6\n\n\nExercise 3 R has a function called rnorm that will allow you to get a random sample of numbers drawn from a normal distribtuion. Get a sample of 5 numbers with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5.\nThere are multiple ways to create arrays of number. As before, we can get a sequence of numbers, 1 thru 10, by 2\n\ns &lt;- seq(1,10,2) #can say \"by=\" before the 2, but it's not necessary\n# Sequence of 11 equally spaced numbers between 0 and 1\ns2 &lt;- seq(0,1,length.out=11) \n\nSide note: what if I don’t want these things in my environment any more?\n\nrm(x)\nrm(q)\nrm(s)\n# Remove everything\n# rm(list=ls())"
